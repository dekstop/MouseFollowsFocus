== Mouse Follows Focus

An OS X utility for multi-display setups: moves the mouse cursor to the currently active display
when switching between applications.

Limitations:
* OSX offers no means of tracking the active _window_ (aka the "key window"), only the active
  application. As a result there's a lot of manual checking and guesswork to determine the key 
  window once we know the frontmost app. Additionally we can't currently detect when window
  focus changes _within_ an app. Yes, that's annoying.
* A few interaction sequences may not quite work yet; e.g. when launching an application on a 
  separate display.
* There's lots more to do. Check the top of AppDelegate.m for a list.

== Troubleshooting: Access for Assistive Devices

Make sure to enable "Access for Assistive Devices" in your system preferences, otherwise we
won't be able to access information about other applications.

In OS X 10.9 Mavericks:
* System Settings > Security & Privacy > Privacy Tab > Accessibility
* Allow access for MouseFollowsFocus
* Restart the MouseFollowsFocus application
